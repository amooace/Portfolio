    <div class="placeholder">Our journey began humbly in 1984 at a guardhouse in China, when Legend Holdings was formed with an investment of just RMB 200,000 (US$ 25,000). In 1988, we opened for business in Hong Kong and, within eight years, we became China’s largest PC company.
        In 2004, we were renamed Lenovo. Today, we are a US$46 billion multinational company with 52,000 employees serving customers in over 160 countries. Ranked #226 on the Fortune 500 list, we are proud to be the world’s largest PC vendor. Our portfolio
        now includes workstations, servers, storage solutions, IT management software, smart TVs, tablets, smartphones, and even apps. As the world becomes faster, more demanding, and more competitive, so has our business By continually innovating, we
        enable our customers to challenge and inspire everyone around them. And help keep things moving forward in a more interesting way.
